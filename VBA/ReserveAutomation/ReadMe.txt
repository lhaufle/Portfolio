Explanation

My company would download an Excel report that would display customers, the amounts they have in receivables, terms,
and how far the receivables aged. They would then perform many caculations on it to calculate the impact on reserve, 
adjusted reserve, and the percentage current. I created an automated spread sheet that allows the user to copy and paste
the information into the first cell and click the automate macro to have all calculations performed while saving the required
format.

Instructions

Select all cells from automation demo--the easiest way is to click the arrow above 1 and to the left of A--then right click to copy. 
The information needs to be pasted into Automated Reserve using cell A1. Then go to Developer->Macros->Automate and follow the prompts
once the macro is run. After the macro is finished, you will notice the changes on the far right and bottom of the spreadsheet.
