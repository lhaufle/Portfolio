This game is an expansion of the Battle dragaon that was created. This demonstrates further usage of OOP practices, but also
adds exception handling and ArrayLists. An abstract class was also used to avoid duplicating lines of code. 

To play the game, run the Battle.java file either through your IDE or compile it using the commandline.
