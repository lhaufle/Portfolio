My company used to download an Excel report that would display customers, the amounts they have in receivables, terms,
and how far the receivables aged. They would then perform many caculations on it to calculate the impact on reserve, 
adjusted reserve, and the percentage current. I created an automated spread sheet that allows the user to copy and paste
the information into the first cell and click the automate macro to have all calculations performed while saving the required
format.
